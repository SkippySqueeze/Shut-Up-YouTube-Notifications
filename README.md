# Shut Up YouTube Notifications

Tired of those parenthesized numerals taking up valuable title space in your YouTube tabs? Can't be bothered to click one button to clear them? This fantastic Chrome extension is for you!

### Pre-reqs

Google Chrome

### Installing

1. Open "chrome://extensions" in your Chrome window
2. Check the "Developer Mode" box
3. Click "Load Unpacked Extension..." and navigate to the folder containing the two extension files
4. You're done! Open a YouTube tab and see if it worked.

### But can't I just click the little bell to clear my notifications?

You sure can. I really just made this for fun. =)
